##  Project content 

In the project you can get more contnents from (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) This will make putting in contents easier

## About Project

on the top of the page on the left is a menu bar, users can click to shop, rent-a-dress, or book an appointment , currenty only the shop link works as this was a test to ensure the links function in the code. 
The carousel slides show 6 images relating to fashion and the versatility, this images were carefully chosen from (www.unsplash.com)
because this project is a landing page for a website, as the collection is still being worked on, by the client 
below the carousel explains the mission of the brand
users are able to input their emails to receive information and a check box to consent receiving promotional emails from the client

## WAI-ARA

This project made use of ARIA accessibility functions in the code to make it a more inclusive design for everyone who visits the sites. 
Thought was put into font size, font family, to make it more visible as well. 
constraints are currently put in place this is why the menu options are greyed out, as there is not link attached to it. 
The bootstrap codes from the link in the project content has ARIA included, to read more on this visit ( https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#at_support)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
